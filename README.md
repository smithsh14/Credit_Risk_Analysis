# Credit_Risk_Analysis

We have been asked to analyis credit card risk using the imbalanced-learn amd scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. We will be using data provided from the credit card company LendingClub. We will be employing various techniques to train and evaluate the models with unbalancd classes. 

## Project Deliverables
This project will consist of four deliverables.
- Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
