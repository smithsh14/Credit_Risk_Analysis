# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning Models

## Purpose
We have been asked to analyis credit card risk using the imbalanced-learn amd scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. We will be using data provided from the credit card company LendingClub. We will be employing various techniques to train and evaluate the models with unbalancd classes:
- Naive Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Undersampling
- Combination Oversampling and Undersampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifer
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifer

### Project Deliverables
This project will consist of four deliverables.
- Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis

## Results
Below you will find the results of the 6 machine learning models. The results will also show their respective balanced accuracy, precision, and recall scores. For Balanced Random Forest Classifer and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier, predicted risk will also be included.
